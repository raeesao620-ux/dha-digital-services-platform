MONITORING ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS REPORT
=====================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The current monitoring system makes impossible performance claims that violate
fundamental Node.js constraints. Immediate architectural changes are required.

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
${this.PERFORMANCE_REALITY_CHECK.map(analysis => 
  `• ${analysis.component}: Claims ${analysis.claimedPerformance}, actually achieves ${analysis.actualPerformance}`
).join('\n')}

ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS:
${this.ARCHITECTURAL_PROBLEMS.filter(p => p.impact === 'critical').map(problem =>
  `• CRITICAL: ${problem.problem} - ${problem.solution}`
).join('\n')}

REQUIRED CHANGES:
1. Implement worker threads for heavy metrics collection
2. Use SharedArrayBuffer for efficient cross-thread communication  
3. Add wall-clock validation of actual sampling frequencies
4. Implement adaptive throttling based on measured performance
5. Document realistic performance targets honestly

REALISTIC TARGETS:
• Main thread: ${this.REALISTIC_TARGETS.mainThread.maxSamplingRate}
• Worker thread: ${this.REALISTIC_TARGETS.workerThread.maxSamplingRate}
• Threat detection: ${this.REALISTIC_TARGETS.workerThread.threatDetection}
• System overhead: ${this.REALISTIC_TARGETS.workerThread.overhead}

RECOMMENDATION:
Implement hybrid architecture with lightweight main thread monitoring
and dedicated worker threads for high-frequency data collection.
